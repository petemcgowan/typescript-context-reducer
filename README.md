Not sure I'm gonna use this _exact approach_. This was the one with a lady on dev.to who did a good explanation, BUT, I thought the ActionMap stuff at the top of reducers.ts confuses things a little. So I ended up not using it.

It also combines two reducers into one, which is standard, but not helpful if looking for an example focused on the basic principles.

It is however a decent example of **Hooks/Context/Reducer in Typescript**. This is the post that explains the code/concepts and where it comes from:

Note that that post is actually a reworking of this post, which gets into the "Typescript fancy" a bit more(TLDR):
